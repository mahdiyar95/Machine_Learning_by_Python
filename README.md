# Fundamental Branch

 fundamental branch : As its name suggests, in fundamental branch there are basic python codes I have seen in practical program, especially ones that seems challenging to realize. This branch includes: 


### 1- Enumerate and zip

### 2- Cumulative rate
There are many situation we want to demonstrate a progress in our algorithm, where the algorithm has computed something step by step and as a result we expect a convergence. This code seems to be useful in many circumstances.
